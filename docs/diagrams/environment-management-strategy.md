# Environment Management Strategy

## Overview Diagram
```mermaid

    subgraph Environments
        DEV[Development]
        TEST[Test]
        STAGE[Staging]
        PROD[Production]
    end
    
    subgraph Management
        CONFIG[Configuration Management]
        MONITOR[Monitoring]
        BACKUP[Backup & Recovery]
        ACCESS[Access Control]
    end

    DEV --> TEST
    TEST --> STAGE
    STAGE --> PROD
    
    CONFIG --> DEV & TEST & STAGE & PROD
    MONITOR --> DEV & TEST & STAGE & PROD
    BACKUP --> DEV & TEST & STAGE & PROD
    ACCESS --> DEV & TEST & STAGE & PROD

    class DEV,TEST,STAGE,PROD env
```

## Environment Promotion Flow
```mermaid

    participant Dev as Development
    participant Test as Test
    participant Stage as Staging
    participant Prod as Production
    
    Dev->>Test: Code Promotion
    Note over Dev,Test: Automated Tests
    Test->>Stage: Validation
    Note over Test,Stage: Integration Tests
    Stage->>Prod: Release
    Note over Stage,Prod: Final Approval
```

## Access Control Matrix
```mermaid

    subgraph Roles
        DEV_TEAM[Development Team]
        QA_TEAM[QA Team]
        OPS_TEAM[Operations Team]
        ADMIN[System Admin]
    end
    
    subgraph Permissions
        READ[Read Access]
        WRITE[Write Access]
        DEPLOY[Deploy Access]
        ADMIN_ACCESS[Admin Access]
    end

    DEV_TEAM --> READ & WRITE
    QA_TEAM --> READ & DEPLOY
    OPS_TEAM --> READ & DEPLOY & WRITE
    ADMIN --> ADMIN_ACCESS
```

## Configuration Management
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Config Management
        direction LR
        SOURCE[Source Control]
        CONFIG_SERVER[Config Server]
        VAULT[Secret Vault]
    end
    
    SOURCE --> CONFIG_SERVER
    CONFIG_SERVER --> DEV & TEST & STAGE & PROD
    VAULT --> DEV & TEST & STAGE & PROD
```

## Notes
- Each environment has isolated resources and configurations
- Automated promotion between environments
- Role-based access control implementation
- Configuration versioning and tracking
- Regular security audits and compliance checks
